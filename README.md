# Gator - Blog Aggregator

Gator is a blog aggregator application built using Go and Postgres. It allows users to fetch and scrape blog posts from various RSS feeds and store them in a database for later consumption. The application provides a CLI to interact with the aggregator and perform various actions like adding feeds, scraping posts, and more.
